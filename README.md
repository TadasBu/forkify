# Forkify

> A Node.js web application project made while learning to JavaScript. In this project I used Food2Fork API. Mainly used ES6 JavaScript, CSS, HTML.

## Features

* Search for a food recipe that is available in Food2Fork 

* Find wanted recipe in the list 

* Choose a wanted recipe and look what ingredients do you need to make it

* Add ingredients to the shopping list 

* Edit or remove ingredients that you already have

* More coming soon..

 
## Getting Started

> This app contains API from Food2Fork but it is not needed to be hidden. MCV architecture was used. Main technologies are JavaScript ES6, Node.js, Babel and NPM.
